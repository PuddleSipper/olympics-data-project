## Day 1 - 27/05/2025
### A3 - A1
1. There are 15 columns in the dataset
2. The "Game" column represents what game and year of the Olympics the player played in. The "Team" column shows what country they play for. The "Event" column represents what specific category of game they played in the Olympics.
3. The first five rows represent individual players, with information about the events, games and general information for their participation within the Olympics, whilst also have some personal information, such as name and ages

### A3 - A2
1. Athletics, Gymnastics, Swimming, Shooting and Cycling were the top 5 sports in the Olympics
2. There were more than double the male athletes compared to the female athletes, nearly triple

### A3 - A3
1. The average age for athletes was 25.56 years old
2. The youngest athlete was 10 years old and the oldest athlete was 97 years old
3. Weight and age had some strange values, with a 97 year old player and a player who weighed 214 kilos, a jump from 75% who was 29 kilos

### A3 - Extension
The URS was the Soviet Union
The GDR was the German Democratic Republic
The FRG was the Federal Republic of Germany

### Reflection
- I learnt that a 10 year old and a 97 year old played in the Olympics
- I didn't find anything really challenging with setting up or using Pandas
- I'd like to analyse some more events, such as concerts or national games to see how they differ from the Olympics
