# I log my work here now!

## Day 1 - 27/05/2025
### A3 - A1
1. There are 15 columns in the dataset
2. The "Game" column represents what game and year of the Olympics the player played in. The "Team" column shows what country they play for. The "Event" column represents what specific category of game they played in the Olympics.
3. The first five rows represent individual players, with information about the events, games and general information for their participation within the Olympics, whilst also have some personal information, such as name and ages

### A3 - A2
1. Athletics, Gymnastics, Swimming, Shooting and Cycling were the top 5 sports in the Olympics
2. There were more than double the male athletes compared to the female athletes, nearly triple

### A3 - A3
1. The average age for athletes was 25.56 years old
2. The youngest athlete was 10 years old and the oldest athlete was 97 years old
3. Weight and age had some strange values, with a 97 year old player and a player who weighed 214 kilos, a jump from 75% who was 29 kilos

### A3 - Extension
The URS was the Soviet Union
The GDR was the German Democratic Republic
The FRG was the Federal Republic of Germany

### Reflection
- I learnt that a 10 year old and a 97 year old played in the Olympics
- I didn't find anything really challenging with setting up or using Pandas
- I'd like to analyse some more events, such as concerts or national games to see how they differ from the Olympics

## Day 2 - Filtering, Sorting & Grouping - 2/06/2025
- Beginning a new sector today

### A4 - A1
1. The first should filter for female athletes and information about them and the second should filter for athletes over the age of 35
2. The female athlete filter returned 74522 rows, the older athletes filter returned 16384

## Day 3 - Continuation - 6/6/2025
### A4 - A4
- 11666 females in Athletics

### A4 - A5
- Done in a4_main

### A4 - A6
- Done in a4_main

## Day 4 - Continuation - 10/6/2025
### A4 - Reflection
- The easiest sorting activites were the ones with only one piece of information we needed to find, as it didn't require I add anything extra in a certain way
- The most difficult grouping and sorting task were the one's where I needed to group using two sets of data and trying to configure the code. I needed to obtain help from a peer in order to complete this
- Typically the tallest athletes would also be the heaviest athletes
- To see what type of body shapes had the best chances of winning gold, to see the range of people that join the olympics and what age ranges they are at

### Trying out directories and managing directories
- I HATE THIS

## Day 5 - Data Cleaning - 13/06/2025

### A5-A1
- Height, Weight and Medal have the most missing values
- Height and Weight might not have been measured, but Medals make sense as only a fair few people can get one

### A5-A2
- 64264 rows were dropped
- Pros: you're able to get more accurate averages about columns with mising data, Cons: you get less accurate average stats and totals for certain values

### A5-A3
